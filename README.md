# supported-ILP

The supported-ILP learning system is a tool for learning programs under the supported model semantics. It is a collection of Python scripts that execute gradient based learning of programs.

Supported models correspond to the weak extensions of default logic and thus provide a mode of non-monotonic reasoning desirable in an introspective agent.
 
The learning task is the same as that of ILASP except that here we have swapped stable models semantics for that of supported models.
